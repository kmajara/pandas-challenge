    "PyCitySchoools data set consists of data representing close to 40,000 students across 15 schools. On an aggregate level, the average math score is 78.9 and the average reading score is  81.8. On close examination of the data, there are multiple nuances. \n",

    "At a school level, charter schools have higher reading and math passing rates, as well as overall passing rates than their district counterparts. \n",
    "Overall, there is no significant variability in reading and math scores across the grades . \n",
    "In terms of spending, it appears that the average math and reading scores, as well as the overall passing rates are inversely proportional  to the amount of dollars spent per student. \n",
    "In terms of school size, small and medium sized schools tend to have higher math, reading, and overall passing rates. While not part of the data sample, a lower teach to student ratio typically observed in smaller schools might be a contributing  factor. In conclusion, small to medium sized charter schools with relatively small budgets perform better in math and reading and have higher overall passing rates. \n"
