PyCity Schools Analysis
Background

As the newly appointed Chief Data Scientist for the city's school district, this project involves analyzing district-wide standardized test results to aid the school board and mayor in making informed decisions about future budgets and priorities. Using Pandas DataFrames, this analysis delves into the math and reading scores of students across various schools, aiming to uncover trends in school performance that could inform strategic planning.
